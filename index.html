      <h2>Preamble</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>read this once</li>

      <h2>The story</h2>
      <p>
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
        evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
        <q
          >We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
          unfortunate.</q
        >
        The farmer said, <q><strong>maybe</strong>.</q> The next day the horse
        came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
        everybody came back and said,
        <q
          >Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
          horses!</q
        >
        The farmer again said, <q><strong>maybe</strong>.</q> The following day
        his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was
        thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
        <q>Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em>,</q> and the farmer
        responded, <q><strong>maybe</strong>.</q> The next day the conscription
        officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they
        rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors
        came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said,
        <q><strong>maybe</strong>.</q>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
        complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
        happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or
        <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you never know what will be the
        consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
        consequences of <em class="good">good</em> fortune.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        <em class="good">good</em> and <em class="bad">bad</em> are just one
        perspective. Bananas are <em class="good">good</em> for monkeys, but
        monkeys are not <em class="good">good</em> for bananas. Let's not make a
        big deal out of it...
